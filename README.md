# Stack-Swift

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

In this project I implemented basic stack operations using Swift programming language both with arrays and linkedlist.

- With Arrays
  
  ```
    push
    pop
    peek
    isEmpty
    display
  ```
- With Arrays
  
  ```
   push
   pop
   peek
   isEmpty
   display
  ```
  
 - Coding Challenges
  ```
    checkBalanceParentheses
  ```
